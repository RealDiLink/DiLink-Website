# DiLink-Website
A HTML/CSS project I made for school !

It's a simple website I made for a school project, I use HTML/CSS and JS for the cursor, the code is not really optimized and clean but I'm quite proud of it !

*It's the first time I've use HTML and CSS It's the reason why a lots of things could be improved !*

I hope you will like this project and remember : **I'm still interested for feedback about that !**
